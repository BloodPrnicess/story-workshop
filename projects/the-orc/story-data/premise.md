# THE ORC - Novella Premise

## Logline
A hyper-masculine tech bro determines his bride through a carnivorous eating contest, believing violence and consumption are the purest expressions of love—a philosophy that ensures their relationship will burn as spectacularly as it ignites.

## The Hook
This is a story that feels like watching a car crash in slow motion—you know exactly where it's headed, you can see the collision coming from miles away, yet you cannot look away. It's a love story told in raw meat and hubris, where the most romantic gesture is devouring a mountain of pork ribs, and the wedding vows might as well be a declaration of mutually assured destruction.

## The Premise

**Marcus "The Orc" Orcutt** is a 31-year-old cybersecurity entrepreneur who has built his entire identity around a philosophy of brutal authenticity. He's disgusted by the performative nature of modern dating—the carefully curated Instagram photos, the strategic texting delays, the pretense of compatibility over coffee and conversation. To Marcus, these are lies. Civilization has domesticated humanity into weakness.

He believes the only honest metrics are primal ones: appetite, aggression, endurance. And so, after years of failed relationships with women he deems "too civilized," too concerned with *seeming* compatible rather than *being* fundamentally matched, he devises The Trial.

**The Trial:** A carnivorous feast. Mountains of meat—primarily pork, his chosen battleground. The woman who can match or exceed his consumption, who approaches the meal not with ladylike restraint but with warrior-like ferocity, will prove herself worthy. She will be his Boudicca. His warrior bride. Together they will build an empire of savage authenticity in a world drowning in pretense.

"I'll set nations ablaze at her feet just to watch the flames dance in her eyes," he posts to his 47,000 followers on his "Raw Masculinity" podcast channel. "Our love will be beautiful in its violence as a tempest hits the Bering Strait, and should it die, it dies as it began, with a mound of bones between us."

His followers eat it up. Literally hundreds of women apply.

## Enter: Delilah Chen

**Delilah** is 29, a fine dining chef who recently imploded her career by telling a James Beard Award winner that his signature dish "tastes like an apology." She's brilliant, acerbic, and currently crashing on her sister's couch while doom-scrolling through her blocked list (73 people in the industry and counting).

She sees Marcus's post. She reads his pseudo-philosophical manifesto about meat and marriage. She watches him describe his ideal woman while gnawing on a turkey leg like a medieval king.

She thinks he is, without question, the most ridiculous man she has ever encountered.

She also thinks: *I could win this in my sleep.*

But here's the thing—Delilah isn't entering The Trial to marry Marcus. She's entering because:
1. The "prize" includes $50,000 (Marcus's idea of a bride price/wedding fund)
2. The event will be filmed and posted to his massive platform
3. She can humiliate him on camera, take the money, and refuse the proposal
4. This will be her revenge against every pompous man in kitchens who told her she was "too aggressive" or "too intense" or "not a culture fit"

It's the perfect crime. Enter the contest, destroy him at his own game, reject him publicly, take the money, resurrect her career.

What could go wrong?

## The Competition

The Trial is absurd. It's held at a BBQ joint Marcus rented out, with a three-person film crew and a hundred pounds of various smoked meats. There are five other female contestants, all of whom seem to be taking this seriously, which makes Delilah feel simultaneously superior and faintly alarmed.

Marcus presides over it like a deranged game show host meets Viking warlord, giving speeches about "the honest clarity of hunger" while wearing an apron that says "MEAT IS MURDER: TASTY, TASTY MURDER."

Delilah approaches the competition with technical precision. She's a chef. She understands pacing, flavor fatigue, the strategic use of palate cleansers (bourbon, in this case). She treats it like an Iron Chef challenge, not a romantic audition.

She wins by three pounds.

Marcus looks at her across the carnage—the stripped bones, the grease-stained plates, the defeated competitors—and his eyes shine with something between love and madness.

"You," he says, "are magnificent. Marry me."

And Delilah, high on victory and bourbon, three-quarters of the way to meat sweats, says what she came to say: "Absolutely not. You're a ridiculous person. I'm taking the money. Thank you for the content."

The video goes viral: "WOMAN DESTROYS TOXIC ALPHA MALE AT HIS OWN CONTEST THEN REJECTS HIM."

Delilah becomes a folk hero overnight. Job offers flood in. Her career is saved.

So why does Marcus's response haunt her?

He didn't rage. Didn't argue. Just looked at her with this unnerving intensity and said: "The trial isn't over. It's just begun. You'll be back."

## The Trainwreck Begins

Because here's the thing: *He's right.*

Delilah can't stop thinking about the contest. Not because she's attracted to Marcus (she tells herself). But because for the first time in years, she felt *alive* during something. She felt seen—not as a woman who should be less, but as a competitor who could be more.

And Marcus? He's obsessed. Truly, genuinely obsessed. He doesn't accept her rejection because to him, the rejection proves she's the one. She's the only woman who ever beat him AND had the spine to walk away. That's the warrior queen energy he's been seeking.

So begins the worst/best courtship in modern history:

- Marcus sends her increasingly unhinged "love letters" that read like declarations of war
- Delilah responds with scathing rejections that he frames and hangs in his apartment
- They engage in a public social media battle that becomes must-watch content
- His followers vs. her followers becomes a whole thing
- They keep "accidentally" ending up at the same restaurants, each trying to out-eat the other in increasingly specific categories

Everyone watching knows this is a disaster. You can see it coming. They're going to crash into each other like two freight trains, and it's going to be spectacular and terrible and probably ruin both their lives.

They start hate-dating. Spite-dating? Each date is a competition. Who can order more dramatically. Whose food philosophy is superior. They argue about Nietzsche over bone marrow. They debate the ethics of foie gras while sharing a dish of foie gras. It's psychosexual and ridiculous.

"This is the worst idea you've ever had," Delilah's sister warns.

"I KNOW," Delilah says, three drinks deep, having just agreed to a second eating contest (crawfish this time).

"You're going to get hurt."

"Or I'm going to hurt him first."

"Delilah, that's not better."

But here's the creeping horror: Delilah is starting to understand Marcus's philosophy. Not because it's right, but because there IS something intoxicating about radical honesty, about relationships stripped of performance. When they fight, it's real. When they compete, it matters. There's no pretense between them. It's awful. It's pure.

And Marcus, for his part, is discovering that loving someone who genuinely challenges him is terrifying. He thought he wanted a warrior bride. He didn't realize that meant someone who could actually wound him. Who does wound him, regularly, with precision strikes to every insecurity he's built his persona around.

## The Point of No Return

Six months in, they've become this toxic, codependent, strangely magnetic thing. They bring out the worst in each other—the competitiveness, the cruelty, the need to win. But they also bring out something real, something neither of them can find anywhere else.

Marcus proposes again. Properly this time, in a private moment, without cameras or spectacle.

"I know this is a bad idea," he tells her. "I know we're going to destroy each other. But I'd rather burn with you than be lukewarm with anyone else."

And Delilah, who has spent six months telling herself this is all a game, realizes with creeping horror that she feels the same way.

She says yes.

## The Wedding/Funeral

They get married at the same BBQ joint where they met, in front of 200 people who are either there to celebrate or witness the disaster (even the guests aren't sure which).

Marcus's vows: "I promise to love you as a tempest loves the shore—violently, completely, and with full knowledge that I might destroy what I touch. Our love will be beautiful in its honesty, terrible in its intensity, and if it dies, it dies as it began: with a mound of bones between us."

Delilah's vows: "I promise to fight you every day. I promise never to let you win easily. I promise to be the knife you sharpen yourself against. And if we crash and burn, at least we'll make a hell of a fire."

Everyone claps nervously.

The marriage lasts three years.

## The Crash

It ends exactly as everyone predicted, yet still somehow shocking in its specificity:

They turn their relationship into content. Everything becomes performance, even the "anti-performance." Their authentic brutality becomes a brand. The thing that made them real becomes the thing that makes them fake.

They compete so constantly that they forget how to cooperate. Every disagreement becomes a battle. Every battle must have a winner. They're so focused on never being the first to submit that neither of them ever surrenders, never compromises, never yields.

The love that was supposed to be beautiful in its violence just becomes violent.

The final fight is about something simultaneously stupid and profound—Marcus wants to open a "primal lifestyle" restaurant, Delilah thinks it's commodifying the only honest thing they had. But really, it's about the fact that they've been at war so long they've forgotten they're supposed to be on the same side.

"I'll set nations ablaze at her feet," Marcus had promised.

In the end, they just set each other ablaze.

## The Epilogue: The Bones Between Them

Two years after the divorce, they run into each other at a hole-in-the-wall Korean BBQ place. They're both with friends, both pretend not to see each other at first.

Finally, Marcus walks over.

"Hey."

"Hey."

An excruciating pause.

"That was insane," Delilah says finally.

"Yeah."

"Would you do it again?"

Marcus thinks about it. Really thinks about it. "No."

"Me neither."

Another pause.

"But I don't regret it," Marcus adds. "Do you?"

Delilah looks at him—this man who once built her a throne of rib bones, who proposed with a Viking sword instead of a ring, who loved her like she was a battle to be won and lost and won again.

"No," she admits. "I don't regret it."

"It was real," Marcus says.

"It was really stupid," Delilah counters.

"Yeah. But it was real."

They stand there in the smell of charcoal and soju, two people who loved each other with such intensity that it became its own form of destruction.

"Take care of yourself, Del."

"You too, Marcus."

He goes back to his table. She goes back to hers. They don't look at each other again for the rest of the meal.

But as she's leaving, Delilah glances back one more time. Marcus is laughing at something his friend said, and for just a moment, she sees him as he was when they met—ridiculous, earnest, absolutely convinced that he had found a philosophy that could make sense of love.

He hadn't.

Neither had she.

But God, they had tried.

And there was something beautiful in that—not in the trying, but in the failing. In the honest, spectacular, inevitable failure of two people who loved each other the only way they knew how, which turned out to be not quite enough.

The car crashed.

The train derailed.

Everyone saw it coming.

And somehow, that doesn't make it any less tragic.

## Themes

- **The commodification of authenticity**: How the pursuit of "realness" becomes its own performance
- **Love as violence vs. violence as love**: When intensity crosses from passion into destruction
- **Masculine fragility dressed as strength**: Marcus's entire philosophy is a cage of his own making
- **The difference between being seen and being understood**: They see each other clearly but never quite understand each other
- **Competitiveness as intimacy**: When striving against someone becomes the only way you know how to be close to them
- **The tragedy of being right about being wrong**: They both knew it would crash and burned anyway

## Why This Works as a Novella

1. **It's laser-focused**: One relationship, one clear arc from collision to combustion
2. **It's darkly comedic**: The absurdity is part of the tragedy
3. **It's inevitable**: Like a Greek tragedy, the end is written in the beginning
4. **It's uncomfortably relatable**: We've all known couples like this, or worse, been in relationships like this
5. **It's perfectly paced for the length**: Novellas thrive on intensity, and this is nothing but intense

## The Reading Experience

This should feel like:
- Watching a horror movie and yelling "DON'T GO IN THERE"
- Scrolling through a Reddit relationship thread and thinking "oh no"
- Being unable to look away from reality TV
- Laughing and cringing simultaneously
- Recognizing yourself in the worst possible ways

The reader should be simultaneously rooting for them and begging them to stop. Should feel relief when they get together and dread at the exact same time. Should want them to work out while knowing, absolutely knowing, they won't.

That's the trainwreck.

That's the story.
